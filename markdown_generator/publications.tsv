01/01/16	FRET analysis using sperm-activating peptides tagged with fluorescent proteins reveals that ligand-binding sites exist as clusters	Journal of Experimental Biology	Long-range cellular communication between the sperm and egg is critical for external fertilization. Sperm-activating peptides (SAPs) are diffusible components of the outer layer of eggs in echinoderms, and function as chemoattractants for spermatozoa. The decapeptide named speract is the best-characterized sea urchin SAP. Biochemical and physiological actions of speract have been studied with purified or chemically synthesized peptides. In this work, we prepared recombinant speract fused to a fluorescent protein (FP; FP-speract) using three color variants: a cyan (eCFP), a yellow (mVenus) and a large Stokes shift yellow (mAmetrine) FP. Although these fluorescence tags are 20 times larger than speract, competitive binding experiments using mAmetrine-speract revealed that this FP- speract has binding affinity to the receptor that is comparable (7.6-fold less) to that of non-labeled speract. Indeed, 10 nmol l −1 eCFP- speract induces physiological sperm responses such as membrane potential changes and increases in intracellular pH and Ca 2+ concentrations similar to those triggered by 10 nmol l −1 speract. Furthermore, FP-speract maintains its fluorescence upon binding to its receptor. Using this property, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements with eCFP-speract and mVenus-speract as probes and obtained a positive FRET signal upon binding to the receptor, which suggests that the speract receptor exists as an oligomer, at least as a dimer, or alternatively that a single speract receptor protein possesses multiple binding sites. This property could partially account for the positive and/or negative cooperative binding of speract to the receptor.

01/07/17	FRET-based binding assay between a fluorescent cAMP analogue and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain tagged with a CFP	FEBS Letters	The cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) functions as a regulatory domain of many proteins involved in cyclic nucleotide signalling. We developed a straightforward and reliable binding assay based on intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an adenosine-3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate analogue labelled with fluorescein and a recombinant CNBD of human EPAC1 tagged with a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP). The high FRET efficiency of this method (~ 80%) allowed us to perform several types of binding experiments with nanomolar range of sample using conventional equipment. In addition, the CFP tag on the CNBD enabled us to perform a specific binding experiment using an unpurified protein. Considering these advantages, this technique is useful to study poorly characterized CNBDs.	Romero <i>et al.,</i> 2017 	Romero_2017	http://fraroco.github.io/files/FRomero_FEBSLETTERS_2017.pdf
02/07/14	Intracellular pH in sperm physiology	Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications	Intracellular pH (pHi) regulation is essential for cell function. Notably, several unique sperm ion transporters and enzymes whose elimination causes infertility are either pHi dependent or somehow related to pHi regulation. Amongst them are: CatSper, a Ca 2+ channel; Slo3, a K + channel; the sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger and the soluble adenylyl cyclase. It is thus clear that pHi regulation is of the utmost importance for sperm physiology. This review briefly summarizes the key components involved in pHi regulation, their characteristics and participation in fundamental sperm functions such as motility, maturation and the acrosome reaction.

01/07/16	CatSper, el canal de Ca2+ que regula el batido flagelar del espermatozoide en eucariontes	Revista Iberoamericana de Ciencia	CatSper is a sperm-specific Ca2+ channel. In mammals, the elimination of any of the distinct pore-forming subunits results in male infertility. CatSper is a moderate voltage-dependent channel, activated by intracellular alkalization and extracellular ligands (in certain species). The activation of this channel exhibits a change in the swimming pattern from an activated to hyperactivated motility. In sea urchin, CatSper has been described as the modulator of the sperm chemotaxis toward the oocyte. Interestingly, this channel is present from the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, it is absent in some taxonomic groups where possibly another protein replaced its function during the evolution.

01/09/18	Robust evaluation of intermolecular FRET using a large Stokes shift fluorophore as a donor	BioTechniques	Fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a straightforward and sensitive technique to evaluate molecular interactions. However, most of the popular FRET pairs suffer cross-excitation of the acceptor, which could lead to false positives. To overcome this problem, we selected a large Stokes shift (LSS) fluorophore as a FRET donor. As a successful example, we employed a new FRET pair mAmetrine (an LSS yellow fluorescence protein)/DY-547 (a cyanine derivative) to substitute CFP/fluorescein that we previously employed to study molecular interactions between cyclic nucleotide binding domains and cyclic nucleotides. The new FRET pair is practically free of cross-excitation of the acceptor. Namely, a change in the fl uorescence spectral shape implies evidence of FRET without other control experiments.

01/08/19	High potassium seawater inhibits ascidian sperm chemotaxis, but does not affect the male gamete chemotaxis of a brown alga	Zygote	Male gamete chemotaxis towards the female gamete is a general strategy to facilitate the sexual reproduction in many marine eukaryotes. Biochemical studies of chemoattractants for male gametes of brown algae have advanced in the 1970s and 1980s, but the molecular mechanism of male gamete responses to the attractants remains elusive. In sea urchin, a K+ channel called the tetraKCNG channel plays a fundamental role in sperm chemotaxis and inhibition of K+ efflux through this channel by high K+ seawater blocks almost all cell responses to the chemoattractant. This signalling mechanism could be conserved in marine invertebrates as tetraKCNG channels are conserved in the marine invertebrates that exhibit sperm chemotaxis. We confirmed that high K+ seawater also inhibited sperm chemotaxis in ascidian, Ciona intestinalis (robusta), in this study. Conversely, the male gamete chemotaxis towards the female gamete of a brown alga, Mutimo cylindricus, was preserved even in high K+ seawater. This result indicates that none of the K+ channels is essential for male gamete chemotaxis in the brown alga, suggesting that the signalling mechanism for chemotaxis in this brown alga is quite different from that of marine invertebrates. Correlated to this result, we revealed that the channels previously proposed as homologues of tetraKCNG in brown algae have a distinct domain composition from that of the tetraKCNG. Namely, one of them possesses two repeats of the six transmembrane segments (diKCNG) instead of four. The structural analysis suggests that diKCNG is a cyclic nucleotide-modulated and/or voltage-gated K+ channel.

01/12/19	Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the sperm-specific sodium/proton exchanger and soluble adenylyl cyclase are key regulators of CatSper among the Metazoa	Zoological Letters	CatSper is a sperm-specific calcium ion (Ca2+) channel, which regulates sperm flagellar beating by tuning cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Although this Ca2+ channel is essential for mammalian fertilization, recent bioinformatics analyses have revealed that genes encoding CatSper are heterogeneously distributed throughout the eukaryotes, including vertebrates. As this channel is activated by cytoplasmic alkalization in mammals and sea urchins, it has been proposed that the sperm-specific Na+ /H+ exchanger (sNHE, a product of the SLC9C gene family) positively regulates its activity. In mouse, sNHE is functionally coupled to soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). CatSper, sNHE, and sAC have thus	Romero <i>et al.,</i> 2019	Romero_2019	http://fraroco.github.io/files/romero_2020.pdf
