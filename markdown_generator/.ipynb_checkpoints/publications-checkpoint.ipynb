      "2016-01-01\tFRET analysis using sperm-activating peptides tagged with fluorescent proteins reveals that ligand-binding sites exist as clusters\tJournal of Experimental Biology\tLong-range cellular communication between the sperm and egg is critical for external fertilization. Sperm-activating peptides (SAPs) are diffusible components of the outer layer of eggs in echinoderms, and function as chemoattractants for spermatozoa. The decapeptide named speract is the best-characterized sea urchin SAP. Biochemical and physiological actions of speract have been studied with purified or chemically synthesized peptides. In this work, we prepared recombinant speract fused to a fluorescent protein (FP; FP-speract) using three color variants: a cyan (eCFP), a yellow (mVenus) and a large Stokes shift yellow (mAmetrine) FP. Although these fluorescence tags are 20 times larger than speract, competitive binding experiments using mAmetrine-speract revealed that this FP- speract has binding affinity to the receptor that is comparable (7.6-fold less) to that of non-labeled speract. Indeed, 10 nmol l −1 eCFP- speract induces physiological sperm responses such as membrane potential changes and increases in intracellular pH and Ca 2+ concentrations similar to those triggered by 10 nmol l −1 speract. Furthermore, FP-speract maintains its fluorescence upon binding to its receptor. Using this property, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements with eCFP-speract and mVenus-speract as probes and obtained a positive FRET signal upon binding to the receptor, which suggests that the speract receptor exists as an oligomer, at least as a dimer, or alternatively that a single speract receptor protein possesses multiple binding sites. This property could partially account for the positive and/or negative cooperative binding of speract to the receptor.\tArcos-Hernández <i>et al.,</i> 2016\tArcos_2016\thttp://fraroco.github.io/files/ArcosC_JEB_2016.pdf\r\n",
      "2017-07-01\tFRET-based binding assay between a fluorescent cAMP analogue and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain tagged with a CFP\tFEBS Letters\tThe cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) functions as a regulatory domain of many proteins involved in cyclic nucleotide signalling. We developed a straightforward and reliable binding assay based on intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an adenosine-3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate analogue labelled with fluorescein and a recombinant CNBD of human EPAC1 tagged with a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP). The high FRET efficiency of this method (~ 80%) allowed us to perform several types of binding experiments with nanomolar range of sample using conventional equipment. In addition, the CFP tag on the CNBD enabled us to perform a specific binding experiment using an unpurified protein. Considering these advantages, this technique is useful to study poorly characterized CNBDs.\tRomero <i>et al.,</i> 2017 \tRomero_2017\thttp://fraroco.github.io/files/FRomero_FEBSLETTERS_2017.pdf\r\n",
      "2014-07-02\tIntracellular pH in sperm physiology\tBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\tIntracellular pH (pHi) regulation is essential for cell function. Notably, several unique sperm ion transporters and enzymes whose elimination causes infertility are either pHi dependent or somehow related to pHi regulation. Amongst them are: CatSper, a Ca 2+ channel; Slo3, a K + channel; the sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger and the soluble adenylyl cyclase. It is thus clear that pHi regulation is of the utmost importance for sperm physiology. This review briefly summarizes the key components involved in pHi regulation, their characteristics and participation in fundamental sperm functions such as motility, maturation and the acrosome reaction.\tNishigaki <i>et al., </i> 2014\tNishigaki_2014\thttp://fraroco.github.io/files/NishigakiT_BIC_2014.pdf\r\n",
      "2016-07-01\tCatSper, el canal de Ca2+ que regula el batido flagelar del espermatozoide en eucariontes\tRevista Iberoamericana de Ciencia\tCatSper is a sperm-specific Ca2+ channel. In mammals, the elimination of any of the distinct pore-forming subunits results in male infertility. CatSper is a moderate voltage-dependent channel, activated by intracellular alkalization and extracellular ligands (in certain species). The activation of this channel exhibits a change in the swimming pattern from an activated to hyperactivated motility. In sea urchin, CatSper has been described as the modulator of the sperm chemotaxis toward the oocyte. Interestingly, this channel is present from the common ancestor of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, it is absent in some taxonomic groups where possibly another protein replaced its function during the evolution.\tNishigaki <i>et al., </i> 2016\tNishigaki_2016\thttp://fraroco.github.io/files/NishigakiT_RIC_2016.pdf\r\n",
      "2018-09-01\tRobust evaluation of intermolecular FRET using a large Stokes shift fluorophore as a donor\tBioTechniques\tFluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a straightforward and sensitive technique to evaluate molecular interactions. However, most of the popular FRET pairs suffer cross-excitation of the acceptor, which could lead to false positives. To overcome this problem, we selected a large Stokes shift (LSS) fluorophore as a FRET donor. As a successful example, we employed a new FRET pair mAmetrine (an LSS yellow fluorescence protein)/DY-547 (a cyanine derivative) to substitute CFP/fluorescein that we previously employed to study molecular interactions between cyclic nucleotide binding domains and cyclic nucleotides. The new FRET pair is practically free of cross-excitation of the acceptor. Namely, a change in the fl uorescence spectral shape implies evidence of FRET without other control experiments.\tSantana-Calvo <i>et al.,</i> 2018\tSantana_2018\thttp://fraroco.github.io/files/Santana-Calvo_BT_2018.pdf\r\n"
