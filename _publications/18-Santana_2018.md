title: "Robust evaluation of intermolecular FRET using a large Stokes shift fluorophore as a donor"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/01/09/18-Santana_2018
excerpt: 'Fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a straightforward and sensitive technique to evaluate molecular interactions. However, most of the popular FRET pairs suffer cross-excitation of the acceptor, which could lead to false positives. To overcome this problem, we selected a large Stokes shift (LSS) fluorophore as a FRET donor. As a successful example, we employed a new FRET pair mAmetrine (an LSS yellow fluorescence protein)/DY-547 (a cyanine derivative) to substitute CFP/fluorescein that we previously employed to study molecular interactions between cyclic nucleotide binding domains and cyclic nucleotides. The new FRET pair is practically free of cross-excitation of the acceptor. Namely, a change in the fl uorescence spectral shape implies evidence of FRET without other control experiments.'
